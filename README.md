What dataset are you going to use?
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Drinking-Water-Quality-Distribution-Monitoring-Dat/bkwf-xfky/about_data
What are your research question(s)?
Are turbidity levels in drinking water samples in New York City associated with precipitation?
What's the link to your notebook?


What's your target visualization?
Include a picture.


What are your known unknowns?
Known: 
Turbidity Measurements
Location & Date of sampling
Other water quality indicators
Unknown:
Precipitation measurements at the exact location and date


What challenges do you anticipate?
Merging two different datasets together as precipitation data may have different date and location formats compared to the water quality data.
Choosing the correct rainfall time window as it is unclear whether turbidity responds to same-day rainfall or previous 24-48 hours.
Limited variation in turbidity due to well-controlled drinking water system, as it would be harder to detect statistically significant associations.
