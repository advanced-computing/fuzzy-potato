Project 1 Part 1: Proposal
Group fuzzy-potato: Emily Chu, Elsie Zhang

1. Dataset
Name: Drinking Water Quality Distribution Monitoring Data

The data tables summarize the turbidity values, coliform, fluoride and chlorine found at sides in distribution each month.

2. Research Questions
How do turbidity levels vary across time (seasonality and long-term trends) in NYC drinking water?

Are turbidity levels in drinking water samples in New York City associated with precipitation?

Is there spatial variation in water quality indicators across sampling locations in NYC?

5. Known Unknowns
known: 

Turbidity measurements across monitoring sites in NYC drinking water distribution system

Location and date of sampling, allowing for temporal and spatial analysis

Other water quality indicators (e.g., chlorine residual, fluoride, and coliform levels)

Monthly monitoring structure, which allows trend and seasonal pattern analysis

unknown: 

Precipitation measurements corresponding to the exact sampling locations and time periods

Potential missing data or incomplete coverage in turbidity measurements (e.g., some sites/months not sampled), which may affect comparisons over time

Whether precipitation affects turbidity immediately or with a lag effect

6. Anticipated Challenges
Merging two different datasets together as precipitation data may have different date and location formats compared to the water quality data.

Choosing the correct rainfall time window as it is unclear whether turbidity responds to same-day rainfall or previous 24-48 hours.

Limited variation in turbidity due to well-controlled drinking water system, as it would be harder to detect statistically significant associations.
