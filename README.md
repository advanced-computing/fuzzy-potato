1. Dataset
Name: [Civilian Complaint Review Board: Allegations Against Police Officers](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Civilian-Complaint-Review-Board-Allegations-Agains/6xgr-kwjq/about_data)

The dataset contains detailed records of civilian allegations of misconduct against NYPD officers, which includes allegation type, officer information, victim demographics, and investigation outcomes. We can use this dataset to conduct an analysis on the patterns and track accountability in police misconduct.

2. Research Questions
How do police misconduct allegations vary across NYPD commands and over time in New York City?

Are NYPD precincts with higher crime levels associated with higher numbers of police misconduct allegations?

3. Notebook Link
4. Target Visualization



5. Known Unknowns
Known: 

Number of misconduct allegations that allows us to measure variation in allegation frequency

NYPD command associated with each allegation enables the comparison of misconduct allegations across different commands

Dates of each allegations to analyze trends over time

Type of misconduct, which we use to analyze whether certain commands have more serious types of allegations

Unknown: 

Number of officers in each command, which would be hard for us to calculate allegation rates per officer

Policing activity levels and crime rates for each precinct that limits the ability to interpret why some commands have more allegations

External factors that influence allegations, such as crime levels, neighborhood characteristics, and population served

6. Anticipated Challenges
Data cleaning and standardization, as there are different naming formats withiin the data that causes inaccurate counts and inconsistencies of data formatting

Data aggregation and interpretation, as multiple allegations may come from the same complaint while each row represents an allegation that affects interpretation

Large dataset size that may cause dashboard loading and filtering to be slow. We might need to pre-aggregate data before visualization through filtering the data
